If one would arrive in Toronto,he/she will start exploring a particular neighbourhood, where they have stayed and then will start exploring another places.\n\nBy keeping in mind this particular thing, I have build this system, which can be helpful to tourism agencies as well as to tourists to make their guide-book for exploring places.",
